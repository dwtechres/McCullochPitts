# McCullochPitts

The McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, developed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943, is one of the earliest formal models of an artificial neuron. It laid the foundation for modern artificial neural networks. The McCulloch-Pitts neuron model is a simplified abstraction of a biological neuron, aiming to capture its essential computational properties.
